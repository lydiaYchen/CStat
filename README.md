# Computational Statistics - BSC, Spring 2025

This is the course repository for the computational statistics course at Data Science Bachelor Program of University of Neuchatel.


##  2. <a name='Coursedescription'></a>Course description and grading :dart:

In this course, there are three modules:
- Part I:  Statistical Inference
- Part II:  Anova analysis and design of experiments
- Part III: Time Series Analysis

This course is continuously evaluated and have following two grading items :dart:
- Three Lab interviews (30\%): pass/fail . Each passing lab accounts for 10 % of the final grade.
  
- Final project: 70 % of the final grade, consisting of three milestones
  * Midterm presentation on the project proposal and progress (April 15): feedback will be given but not graded
  * Final presentation on the project (May 27): graded
  * Final project report (due on May 27): graded
